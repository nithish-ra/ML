## üéØ Objective

The primary goal of this experiment is to build and evaluate a Linear Regression model to predict the loan amount sanctioned to a user based on various personal and financial features. The project also focuses on interpreting the model's results to understand the key factors influencing loan sanction decisions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**
    * Irrelevant columns were dropped.
    * Missing values were handled by filling numerical columns with the mean and categorical columns with the mode.
    * Categorical features were converted to numerical format using `LabelEncoder`.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps were used to understand data distributions and feature relationships.
    * Boxplots were used to identify outliers in key numerical features.

3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    * Outliers in features like `Income (USD)` and `Loan Amount Request (USD)` were treated by clipping values at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce their skewing effect on the model.

4.  **Model Training & Evaluation:**
    * The dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for validation.
    * Features were standardized using `StandardScaler`.
    * A Linear Regression model was trained on the preprocessed data.
    * The model's performance was evaluated using K-Fold Cross-Validation (K=5) to ensure robustness.

## üìä Results Summary

The model's performance was evaluated on the validation set, yielding the following key metrics:

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 21,479.00
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 30,346.77
* **R¬≤ Score:** 0.5744
* **Adjusted R¬≤ Score:** 0.5737

The cross-validation results confirmed this performance, with an average R¬≤ score of **0.57**, indicating that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
